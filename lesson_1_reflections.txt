How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Saved from having to read the entire document. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Easy to see changes along the way

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You designate the different versions. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It would get messy to have so many different versions.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Haven't learned yet. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always go back to the old one!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Don't know yet :)
